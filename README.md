# Computer_Lab_Model_Networks
The "Virtual Lab Network" project utilizes the Cisco Tracer app to create a simulated model of computer labs. Our objective is to replicate the setup of physical computer labs within a virtualized environment, enabling students and researchers to gain practical experience with networking concepts in a safe and controlled setting.
